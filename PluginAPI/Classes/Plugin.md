## `Plugin<TConfig>` : `IPlugin<TConfig>`
`Abstract`  
Plugin class represents the base class for all plugins, as well as the entry point for the plugin's source code. Each plugin needs to have one class that inherits from the Plugin class in order to function. The plugin class must have an `OnEnabled` override, as well as an `OnDisabled` override that undoes what `OnEnabled` does.  

### `string` Name
`virtual`  
Determines the name of the plugin. The name will default to the assembly's name.  

### `string` Author
`virtual`  
Determines the author of the plugin. The author will default to the assembly's company name.  

### `PluginPriority` Priority
`virtual`  
Determines the priority of the plugin. [PluginPriority info](https://github.com/SCPET/PluginFramework-Docs/blob/master/PluginAPI/Enums/PluginPriority.md).  

### `Version` Version
`virtual`  
Determines the current version of the plugin. The version will default to the assembly's version, and must change for **every** update, as server hosts use this to determine when their plugin is outdated.  

### `Version` RequiredVersion
`virtual`  
Determines the minimum game version that is required in order for this plugin to function properly.  

### `void` OnEnabled()
`virtual`  
OnEnabled is called when the plugin is started by the server. This method is called while the server is booting up. All event connections should be connected in this method.  

### `void` OnDisabled()
`virtual`  
OnDisabled is called when the plugin is disabled by the server. This method is called when the server is shutting down, or the plugin is disabled by a server staff member. All event connections should be disconnected in this method.
