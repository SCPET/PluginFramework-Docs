# SCP914Restrictions
This folder contains the code for a plugin that adds a restriction to how many times SCP-914 can be used per round.
* The MainPlugin.cs file contains the body plugin
* The PluginConfig.cs file contains the configuration for the plugin
* The EventHandlers.cs file handles the events.
The code is meant to be learned from - copying and pasting this code will NOT work. It should also be noted that plugins do not NEED to be set up like this plugin is set up, however it is a cleaner approach and is preferred.
