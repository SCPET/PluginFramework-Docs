 * This simple plugin makes it so that gas damage is not dealt to the player.
 * This is an example of disallowing events. Most events can be disallowed. Check the documentation for which events can and can't be disallowed.
 * This is an example of the plugin framework - This code will NOT work if inserted directly into the plugins folder.
